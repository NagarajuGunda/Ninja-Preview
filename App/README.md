# Qml Preview
This is a sub system used for preview purposes only.

# Why it came into being
It is supposed to be a somewhat replacement
for the default qmlscene that came with every PyQt installation.
But since PyQt5.10 it hasn't been included in the installation folder.

A way around it used to be to include a copy from the installation
of Qt's official software development bundle found on Qt's official
site Qt.com. But this also fails in PyQ5.11.

So, this is supposed to be a stand-alone qmlscene sort of replacement.

# Error reporting
It may cause errors, so report every error at www.Github.com/amoh-godwin/Ninja-Preview
Open a new issue
and state the error.

# Usage
at the command prompt do:
''''qmlview <file>''''
eg:
''''qmlview path/to/myqmlfile.qml'''

Use at own discretion.
